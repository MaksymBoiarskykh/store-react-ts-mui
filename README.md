This is an online store that receives products using the Rest API. They can be sorted, filtered, and viewed by category. You can also add a product to a basket or view product information


I used technologies: create-react-app, typescript, react, redux toolkit, rtk query, redux persist, react-router, fake store API, MUI.


Here you can see result - https://maksymboiarskykh.github.io/store-react-ts-mui/


The purpose of this work was to improve understanding of the MUI, redux toolkit, rtk query and typescript.
